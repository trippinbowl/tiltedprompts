# TiltedPrompts — Go-To-Market & Community Building Plan
## India-First, Internationally Scalable

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TiltedPrompts sits at the intersection of AI infrastructure and the Indian builder economy. The strategy is: **build loud in India, attract globally.** We position as the "production AI infrastructure company built in India, for the world" — leveraging India's 30M+ developer population, the world's largest WhatsApp market (500M+), and the emerging "vibe coding" movement.

---

## PART 1: BRAND POSITIONING

### Core Narrative
**"We build the infrastructure that lets you ship software at the speed of thought."**

Not another AI wrapper. Not another chatbot company. TiltedPrompts builds the *pipes and protocols* — the unsexy, critical infrastructure that every AI-powered product needs but nobody wants to build from scratch.

### Brand Voice
- **Technical but accessible** — write like a senior engineer explaining to a smart junior
- **Confident, not arrogant** — "we built this" not "we're the best"
- **Builder-first** — always speak to the person who ships, not the person who talks
- **India-proud, globally relevant** — never apologize for being from India

### Taglines to Use
- "Infrastructure for the Builder Economy"
- "From prompt to production"
- "Ship at the speed of thought"
- "The agentic coding platform"
- "Built in India. Built for builders."

## PART 8: COMPETITIVE MOAT

**What makes TiltedPrompts defensible:**

1. **India-first infrastructure** — No Western competitor understands regional languages, WhatsApp automation, or Indian payment flows like we will
2. **MCP marketplace network effects** — More servers → more users → more servers. First to build liquidity wins
3. **Integrated stack** — MCP + Voice + Code templates = one platform. Competitors are point solutions
4. **Community moat** — Developer communities are the hardest thing to replicate. Start early, engage genuinely
5. **Cost advantage** — Indian engineering talent + lower infrastructure costs = sustainable unit economics
